	<h3><p> About Me </h3></p>
	  <p>I am currently a second year doctoral student at Harvard's Department of Economics. My research interests 
	  	currently include public economics, questions in federal/state and local fiscal policy, and spatial economics. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 
		  2016 with a degree in Economics, Statistics and Public Policy. In my free time, I enjoy baking, lifting
      heavy weights and hiking.    </p>
