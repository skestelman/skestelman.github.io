<p> Neutralizing NIMBYs: Effect of Community Voice in Land Use Decisions (Job Market Paper) <br>
<div align="justify" style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> 
<!-- 	This paper estimates the benefits and costs of urban communities having a say over what gets built in their neighborhoods. 
	I leverage the rollout of the Transit-Oriented Communities (TOC) program in Los Angeles, CA, which is one of the least affordable cities in the United States. 
	Approved via ballot measure, the program reduced community influence over the approval of qualifying multifamily projects. I show that housing supply increases near major public transit stops. 
	In particular, more buildings with over 50 units are developed, due to the TOC program’s provision to reduce discretion over buildings of that size.

<p>  Environmental Externalities of Urban Growth: Evidence from the California Wildfires (New draft coming soon!)  <br>
<div style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> Media coverage: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/californias-housing-and-wildfire-crises-are-on-a-collision-course-bbcb9b81?mod=mhp"> WSJ </a>  </div>
<div align="justify" style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px"> Most wildfires in California are human-caused. This paper uses geospatial data to quantify how land development, which increases human activity, affects ignition probability and creates environmental externalities. Housing development affects ignition probability non-monotonically. Converting 2.5 acres of wildland into low-density development in the Wildland-Urban Interface increases the annual probability of wildfire ignition by 0.34 percentage points using OLS estimation or 0.67 percentage points using IV estimation, compared to an average annual probability of 1.74 percent. The probability of ignition decreases as land development intensity increases. However, this relationship becomes less concave, and ignition externalities more widespread, during drier years. These findings suggest the need for managed land development policies along the urban-wildland edge as climate change leads to more frequent droughts. Property buyouts combined with building bans emerge as the most effective form of development restriction, while policies that limit maximum density can increase expected wildfire costs.

<p>    Equilibrium Effects of Eviction Protections: The Case of Legal Assistance (with Rob Collinson, John Eric Humphries, Scott Nelson, Winnie van Dijk, and Daniel Waldinger)  <br>
<div style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> Under review <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/californias-housing-and-wildfire-crises-are-on-a-collision-course-bbcb9b81?mod=mhp"> WSJ </a>  </div>

“Right-to-counsel” programs provide free legal assistance to tenants in eviction court. Legal assistance can delay or prevent eviction. However, large-scale legal assistance programs can also generate costs for tenants due to equilibrium rental market responses. In this paper, we study how right to counsel impacts rental markets when implemented at scale, and quantify the policy’s impact on tenant welfare. Leveraging the geographic rollout of New York City’s program, we find listed rent prices rose by $22-$38/month within two years of policy implementation, with larger increases in areas with higher baseline eviction rates. We do not find evidence that landlords adjusted on other margins, such as tenant screening or improvements to habitability. Guided by these results, we develop a framework to evaluate the policy’s welfare implications for tenants, incorporating the trade-off between protection from eviction and higher rent prices. We quantify the parameters of our framework using linked data on eviction court cases, rental housing listings, and tenant earnings trajectories. Despite the direct benefits and insurance value of stronger eviction protections, the estimated price increases are large enough to generate a small net reduction in ex-ante tenant welfare. </div> </p>
