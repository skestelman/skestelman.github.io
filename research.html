<p> Neutralizing NIMBYs: Effect of Community Voice in Land Use Decisions (Job Market Paper) <br>
<div align="justify" style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> 
	This paper estimates the benefits and costs of urban communities having a say over what gets built in their neighborhoods. I leverage the rollout of the Transit-Oriented Communities (TOC) program in Los Angeles, CA, which is one of the least affordable cities in the United States. Approved via ballot measure, the program reduced community influence over the approval of qualifying multifamily projects. I show that housing supply increases near major public transit stops. In particular, more buildings with over 50 units are developed, due to the TOC programâ€™s provision to reduce discretion over buildings of that size. I then describe the drivers of opposition to similar multifamily projects before the policy. Using large language models and other natural language processing tools, I construct a dataset that links pre-TOC project applications to the comments made in support or opposition by the public. Parking, affordability and neighborhood change are the main concerns, and are a bigger source of concern in less dense neighborhoods with access to public transit. More negative sentiment correlates with lower approval rates for similar projects in similar locations. Finally, I compare the impacts of the multifamily projects enabled by the policy with the impacts predicted by the local community.

<p>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4629558"> Environmental Externalities of Urban Growth: Evidence from the California Wildfires </a>  <br>
<div style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> Media coverage: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/californias-housing-and-wildfire-crises-are-on-a-collision-course-bbcb9b81?mod=mhp"> WSJ </a>  </div>
<div align="justify" style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px"> I use geospatial data from California to quantify the environmental externalities of housing
development in wildfire-prone areas. Housing impacts wildfire probability non-monotonically.
In the cross-section, each additional house between 0 and 300 housing units increases wildfire
probability by 0.01 (OLS) or 0.24 (IV) percentage points from a baseline of 0.918 percent. Each
unit beyond 300 decreases wildfire probability by 0.01 (OLS) or 0.45 (IV) percentage points
until the probability reaches zero. Long difference estimates show similar non-linear impacts.
Property buyouts combined with building bans are the most effective form of development
restriction. Policies that limit maximum density can increase expected wildfire costs. </div> </p>
