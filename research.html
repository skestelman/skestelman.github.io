<p> The Economics of Discretion in Land Use Decisions (Job Market Paper) <br>
<div align="justify" style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> This paper uses quasi-experimental variation to study the benefits and costs of discretion in land use decisions. I leverage the Transit-Oriented Communities  (TOC) policy in the City of Los Angeles, which limited community discretion for a subset of projects within .5 mile of bus, metro and rail stops. I first estimate the impact of this policy on supply, both on the extensive margin (i.e., whether more projects are proposed for entitlement and permitted) and the intensive margin (i.e., how many units, building floor-to-area ratio, number of income-restricted units). Then, I estimate the impact of TOC projects on property values, rents, crime, 311 calls, and local community composition. I argue that these projects would have had to undergo discretionary review absent the policy reform, so they are only selected based on profitability, and not on the probability of community approval. Finally, I build a model of discretion in land use decisions that captures the trade-off between by-right and discretionary approval.

<p>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4629558"> Environmental Externalities of Urban Growth: Evidence from the California Wildfires </a> (submitted) <br>
<div align="justify" style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> I use detailed geospatial data from California to estimate the environmental externalities of urban development. I show that existing and new housing in wildfire-prone areas impacts wildfire probability non-monotonically. Each additional house between 0 and 300 housing units increases wildfire probability by .009-.238 percentage points from a baseline average of .918 percent in areas with no housing units. Each additional unit beyond 300 decreases wildfire probability by 0.014-.451 percentage points until the probability of wildfire approaches zero.
Property buyouts combined with building bans are the most effective form of development restriction. Minimum lot size or maximum density restrictions, on the other hand, can increase expected wildfire costs. Counterfactual simulations show the importance of policy design and targeting in settings with non-monotonic externalities. </div> </p>
