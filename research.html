<p> The Economics of Discretion in Land Use Decisions (Job Market Paper) <br>
<div align="justify" style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> This paper uses quasi-experimental variation to study the benefits and costs of discretion in land use decisions. I leverage the Transit-Oriented Communities  (TOC) policy in the City of Los Angeles, which limited community discretion for a subset of projects within .5 mile of bus, metro and rail stops. I first estimate the impact of this policy on supply, both on the extensive margin (i.e., whether more projects are proposed for entitlement and permitted) and the intensive margin (i.e., how many units, building floor-to-area ratio, number of income-restricted units). Then, I estimate the impact of TOC projects on property values, rents, crime, 311 calls, and local community composition. I argue that these projects would have had to undergo discretionary review absent the policy reform, so they are only selected based on profitability, and not on the probability of community approval. Finally, I build a model of discretion in land use decisions that captures the trade-off between by-right and discretionary approval.

<p>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4629558"> Environmental Externalities of Urban Growth: Evidence from the California Wildfires </a>  <br>
<div align="justify" style="color: Gray; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -15px"> Does residential development at the urban edge increase the probability and cost of wildfires
in California? I use geospatial data to show that the probability of wildfires increases as
previously undeveloped land becomes developed, but decreases at higher levels of development
until the probability of wildfire reaches zero. At very low housing densities, an additional
housing unit increases the probability of wildfire by .01-.02 percentage points over a baseline
probability of 1.53. This translates into an increase the probability of wildfire from 1.53 to 4.34
percent when housing density increases from 30 to 130 units per km2. I then calculate costs
for a set of wildfires under counterfactual patterns of housing development. Due to the nonmonotonic
relationship between development and wildfire probability, restricting some but not
all development in fire-prone areas can have a larger impact on wildfire probability. I discuss
how land use restrictions in safe areas relate to higher expected costs of wildfires. </div> </p>
